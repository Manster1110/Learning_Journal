# Learning_Journal

The Learning Journal was an initial pilot project for creating a learning journal that could be used to record learning activities by
associates of H&R Block.

The project was created using Python 3.5, Django, and Bootstrap.

User of the program could create an account and then begin to record specific learning topics and detailed entries for each topic.
